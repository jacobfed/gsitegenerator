          "description" :"Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity for patients suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Both the presence of visually assessed emphysema on CT scans and abnormal pulmonary function tests are associated with the development of lung cancer. Based on recent results showing that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to CT scans can predict spirometrically-defined COPD ( F EV1 F V C < 0.7), we hypothesized that CNN-based classification of COPD and emphysema is predictive of lung cancer development in the National Lung Cancer Screening (NLST) cohort. We trained spirometric COPD and visual emphysema CNN classifiers using data from the COPDGene study. The classifiers were then used to generate COPD and emphysema scores (CSCNN and ESCNN , respectively) on 7347 CT scans from the NLST study. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to else: #os.mkdir(html_path) model the effects of CSCNN , ESCNN , age, body mass index, education, gender, smoking pack-years, and years since smoking cessation on lung cancer diagnosis. It was found that, individually, both CSCNN and ESCNN were statistically significant predictors (p<0.000 and p<0.000, respectively) of lung cancer diagnosis hazard.",

Consequently, a number of clinical trials are underway encompassing a diverse array of targets and agents. However, the primary endpoint used for assessing therapeutic response continues to be gross tumor volumetric change. This endpoint may not be the best choice for measuring the effectiveness of those molecularly targeted agents that do not uniformly elicit a significant reduction in tumor volume (37–39). Therefore, there is an impetus to explore non-invasive quantitative imaging modalities, such as MRI and positron emission tomography, for their potential to provide non-invasive biomarkers of treatment response. In fact, DCE-MRI and DW-MRI metrics have shown significant promise as biomarkers of early cancer therapeutic response (40,41). The goal of this study was to evaluate DCE-MRI and DW-MRI for their ability to detect and quantify the therapeutic response of glioma-bearing animals treated with VEGF-Trap.",
